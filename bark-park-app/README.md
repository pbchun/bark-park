# BarkPark

Bark Park is a mobile app that allows dog owners to sign up for an account, create a profile for each of their dogs, and check to see which dogs are currently at their favorite dog park. 

This app was created as part of my Capstone project for the Web Development Program at Galvanize. I had ten days to learn a new technology (React Native) to create a full-stack application. I used react native router flux, react native elements, and native base on the front-end, and Express, Knex.js, PostgreSQL, and Node.js for the back-end which was deployed to Heroku.

This app is an on-going project that I am working on.
